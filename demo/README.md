# Converting from Live2D MOC3

1. Download the Live2D Model file from the official Live2D website or other sources.
2. Convert the MOC3 file to `.moc3.json` conversion using [`moc32json`](../tools/moc32json) tool.
3. Open the converted `.moc3.json` file in Lite2D Editor to further edit and refine the model.
4. Save the model's additional data `.moc3.render-settings.json`, `.moc3.face-parts.json` using Lite2D Editor.
5. Use the model in your Lite2D-based applications by loading the `.moc3.json` file along with its associated resources.

> [!NOTE]  
> Given demo files are already refined and ready to use in Lite2D applications.  
> But you still have to convert original MOC3 files to `.moc3.json` format as described above.

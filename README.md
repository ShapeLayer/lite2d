# lite2d

lite2d is a suite of lightweight "VTuber" character expression systems that track the facial expressions of people recognized on the camera and reflect them on character expressions in real time.

> Create an original work using still images or moving images (video).  
> 
> 《Examples》  
> - Morphing Animation: Create a morphing sequence that smoothly transitions from Image A to Image B using your own software or a publicly available morphing tool (if possible, use warping in addition to simple cross-dissolving).  
> - Image Processing System (Python/OpenCV): Develop an image-based application system using Python or OpenCV. (<u>A "VTuber-style" system where a character’s facial expressions change in real-time</u> to match the expressions of a person captured on camera.)
> - Chroma Key Production: Produce a work using chroma key compositing. (Green screens are available for loan).
> - Silent Short Film: Produce a silent (no audio) video work, approximately several seconds long, centered around a specific theme.

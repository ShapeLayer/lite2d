# moc32json

moc32json is a lightweight MOC3-to-JSON converter.

## Getting Started

Download Live2D Cubism SDK for Native from [Live2D Official Site](https://www.live2d.com/download/cubism-sdk/download-native/) and extract it somewhere. (`./external/CubismNativeFramework` is recommended)

If you extract the SDK somewhere else, set the path to the `Core` directory of the extracted SDK in the CMake variable `LIVE2D_CORE_DIR` when configuring the project with CMake: Refer [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt)
